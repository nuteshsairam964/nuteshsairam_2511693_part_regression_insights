Retail Store Sales Regression Insights
Project Overview
This project analyzes the factors that influence monthly sales across retail stores using regression analysis in Microsoft Excel. The objective is to identify the business variables associated with monthly sales, compare regression models, and provide data-driven recommendations for improving store performance.

Business Problem
The retail company operates multiple stores across different regions and store formats. Management has observed variation in monthly sales across stores and wants to understand which operational, marketing, and customer-related factors are associated with higher sales.

The analysis aims to answer the following business question:

Which business factors have the greatest influence on monthly sales, and how can management use these insights to improve store performance?

Business Objective
The objectives of this project are to:

Identify the key drivers of monthly sales.
Build and compare simple and multiple regression models.
Evaluate model performance using regression statistics.
Interpret model outputs in business terms.
Recommend actions based on analytical findings.

Variables Excluded from Regression
store_id
Excluded because it is a unique identifier and does not provide predictive information about sales.

monthly_profit
Monthly profit is treated as a separate business outcome. Since the objective of this project is to explain monthly sales, it is not used as an independent variable.

Data Preparation Plan
The following preprocessing steps will be completed before regression analysis:

Review the dataset for missing values.
Check for duplicate records.
Verify data types.
Create dummy variables for categorical variables (region and store_type).
Prepare the dataset for regression modelling.
Regression Approach
The project will be completed in the following stages:

Data Understanding
Data Preparation
Dummy Variable Creation
Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Model Comparison
Residual Analysis
Business Interpretation
Final Recommendation
Tools Used
Microsoft Excel
Excel Data Analysis ToolPak
Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Data Quality Checks

Verified the dataset for duplicate records; no duplicate rows were found.
Identified missing values in competitor_distance_km (6) and customer_rating (8).
Replaced missing values using the respective column mean.
Verified that numerical and categorical variables had appropriate data types.
Performed basic validation to ensure there were no invalid or impossible values.
